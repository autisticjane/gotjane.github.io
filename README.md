# gotjane.github.io
This exists because although I don't always, I still code on occasion. I'm cleaning out a lot of my websites. I like having a Github Pages site 'cause it's fun, and ``jane.fyi`` is used for my personal link shortener (``go.jane.fyi``); I also am letting ``effys.space`` go, but wanted a central space for my random projects.
