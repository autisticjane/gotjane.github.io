            <h1>Effy's ___</h1>
                <p>Welcome to my space on the internet. I'm Effy, but if you're not into TCGs, you know me as Jane.</p>
            <h2>The deets</h2>
                <h3 class="accordion lowercase">About the site</h3>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>It's kind of a long story, but the gist is that I wanted to keep my online trading card game (oTCG) stuff separate from my blog, but also in a way that reflected who I am. Effy's Space isn't a collective, but it is a bit of a sandbox to host my projects. The idea of keeping a sandbox on the same domain as my blog seemed weird.</p>

                <h3 class="accordion lowercase">Can I adopt Zest?</h3>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Funny story! I adopted Zest out, but nothing ever came to it when I was missing it and ready to run it again, so&hellip;I realized adopting it out was pointless and got too many peoples' hopes up, and I'm not gonna drag Zest's <em>amazing</em> players/fans/foodies through the mud of hope again.</p>
                        <p><small>P.S. I low-key want to call you guys "Zestites", but that high-key sounds like an STD or type of bug that you randomly find in your bed at night.</small></p>

                    <p class="panel">This index page. A little bit of this and that. Poke around to learn more, because I don't want to keep up with this part. Otherwise, you'll find out when I'm finished&hellip;if I release it to the public. Whenever that is, if that ever is, etc.</p>
                <h3 class="accordion lowercase">When is Zest coming back?!</h3>
                    <p class="panel">Information about <a href="/zest">Zest</a> is on its respective directory.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>I have commitment issues. It's hard for me. I set out to do something, and then suddenly it's three months later. Because I forget.</li>
                            <li>I do a <em>lot</em> of other things. I'm fascinated by culture and learning.</li>
                            <li>Burnout sucks.</li>
                            <li>I don't always feel like I fit in in the community, tbh. And it's not exactly like I'm the easiest to get on with.</li>
